# NaturalEvolvedComputerLanguage
This repo assume a human language evolved by natural and according this supposing we are gonig to create self evolved computer language.

# Idea Explanation
How the human language is evolved by naturally, we assume a computer language that evolves by the time according to the response from another computer.
Human languages are ivolved by time. We are adding and naturally some of particules are erased because of the pop-cultural differences for instance.
According to this idea we are expecting a computer language out of a computer communication and additionally given a few more material as if pop-culture or etique in human life and then we experiment that how the complexity of a computer language ivolves by the time which is corresponds to GRAMMER rules that we have ivolved by the time. So we can analyze a grammatical rules ivolment of an little Artificial Intelligent's approach as a language.

Benefit will be the good communication by the lucurativenes of completement for a command which is corresponded to the understanding in terms of human being.
